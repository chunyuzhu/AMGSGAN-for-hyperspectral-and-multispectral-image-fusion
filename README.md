# AMGSGAN
AMGSGAN for hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion.
This is the code of Chunyu Zhu et al. , “An Adaptive Multi-perceptual Implicit Sampling for Hyperspectral and Multispectral Remote Sensing Image Fusion,”  International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation (JAG), 2023.

The IEEE2018 example data in the data folder can be downloaded here http://hyperspectral.ee.uh.edu/QZ23es1aMPH/2018IEEE/phase2.zip. Note that we have only used the 48 bands of the hyperspectral data
